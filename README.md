# Master Script

Welcome to the Molecular Master Script repository! This script is designed to facilitate the installation of the standard Molecular package manager (MOLE) on Linux systems. 

## Features

- **Automated Installation**: The script automatically downloads and installs the Molecular package manager from the official repository.
- **Network Issue Handling**: The script checks for network issues during the download process and prompts the user to retry or exit if a problem is detected.
- **Existing Package Handling**: If the package is already installed, the script allows the user to uninstall, upgrade, or reinstall the package.
- **Progress Bars**: Color-coded progress bars provide a visual indication of the download and installation process.
- **Interactive Prompts**: The script interacts with the user to handle existing files and installation options.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/masterscript.git

3. Run the script with `sudo`:
